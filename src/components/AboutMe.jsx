          <p>
            I am Carlos Santiago, currently located in Vancouver, BC. Throughout
            my childhood, I played video games for long hours almost everyday,
            the SNES and N64 were the peak console gaming for me. When I was in
            my teens my 2 biggest passions were playing guitar and playing
            online games like starcraft, AoE and then Counter-Strike. My passion
            for music keasdasdasdasdpt growing in my teens, I started to record
            my own music and play in bands.
